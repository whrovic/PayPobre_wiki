## **Sprint Retrospective:**

- **Do well**: On this sprint we made huge improvements in our teamwork. Also, everything we established to do, we actually accomplished. There are some screenshots available in our repo to allow anyone to get a glimpse of our work.
- **Do different**: From now on we definitely have to accelerate our progress, but our team is quite motivated right now.
- **Puzzles**: In the beginning we had many issues, we even had to start our project all over again twice, but these are some topics where we had some trouble:
  * Making sure our project would work and run on each one of our systems.
  * Establishing a definitive file structure to our project
  * Switching scenes and handling events in JavaFX
  * Learning SQL language
  * Gerring familiar to Scene Builder all of its capability
