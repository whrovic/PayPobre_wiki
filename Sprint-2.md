**Done User Stories:**
Unfortunately, we couldnÂ´t accomplish any User Story from the Product Backlog before the deadline, but we managed to accomplish some important minor steps to start our project.

**Sprint Retrospective:**
On this Sprint, we recognize that we should have done further advancements on code, . Despite that it was very productive. In the beginning we were overwhelmed by all the new concepts we had to learn in order to apply on this project, but now we feel quite comfortable with them and, as a team, we all have a stronger vision 

**Sprint Review:**
The goal of this sprint was more oriented to tech spikes. Getting familiar with git and database concepts allowed us to define very well our future sprints, already knowing how to approach each user story, respectively.
