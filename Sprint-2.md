# **Resume Deliverable**

**Sprint Goal:** Kick off.

**Sprint Planning:**

| ID | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Familiarization with git and PostgreSQL | Done |
| 2 | Defining the folder and package structure | Done |
| 3 | Connection to Database | Done |
| 4 | Create tables on Database | Work in progress |
| 5 | Adding users to our database | To be started |

**Done User Stories:** Unfortunately, we couldn´t accomplish any User Story from the Product Backlog before the deadline, but we managed to accomplish some important minor steps to start our project.

**Sprint Retrospective:** On this Sprint, we recognize that we should have done further advancements in our project, we were expecting to be able to start adding users to our database, but only when we started, we realized that we underestimated the complexity of some details. \
Despite that, it was productive. In the beginning we were overwhelmed by all the new concepts we had to learn, but now we are more comfortable with them and, as a team, we all have a stronger vision of what we want from our project.

**Sprint Review:** The goal of this sprint was more oriented to tech spike, so we didn´t really added any new feature to our project.\
Although Git and PostgreSQL are just elemental tools to assist us on this project, they had to addressed, and getting familiar with them took us more time than expected.\
Besides that, we are quite motivated and optimistic, and we already have concrete plans for the next sprint
